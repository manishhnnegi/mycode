    "## Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Models in Pydantic are classes that inherit from `BaseModel`. They define the data structure using type annotations and offer avenues for data validation and conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nested Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested Models allow you to represent complex, nested data structures by defining models within models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields are the individual variables defined within a model. They can have additional configurations and validations beyond the basic type annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Field Validators\n",
    "\n",
    "Field Validators are functions used to apply additional validations or transformations to fields before they are set in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Validators\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Validators allow for validation at the model level, occurring after all the Field Validators have been executed. They can be performed both pre and post-field validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computed Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Computed Fields are fields whose values are dynamically computed from the values of other fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integration with Dataclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "Pydantic offers integrations with Python Dataclasses to simplify type safety and data validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Settings for Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Pydantic enables the loading and validation of settings from environment variables, simplifying the configuration of your applications.\n"
